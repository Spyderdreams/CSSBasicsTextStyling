Assignment 8.1: CSS Basics - Text Styling

This project displays Article I of the U.S. Constitution using semantic HTML and a completely redesigned CSS layout. The HTML and CSS are separated for maintainability and follow modern best practices for readability, responsiveness, and accessibility.

Files Included:
- constitution.html
- style.css
- readme.txt

Validation Results:
- HTML: Passed with one warning about the missing `lang` attribute, which has now been fixed.
- CSS: Passed with no errors (CSS Level 3 + SVG).

Description:
This project uses a refreshed layout with the following design features:
- Clean white background with a centered article layout
- Modern serif font (Georgia) for a formal, readable style
- Clear heading hierarchy with distinct color accents
- Improved spacing and margins for better content flow
- Link styles with hover effects and visited state
- Responsive layout using media queries for small screen sizes

The page is easy to read, self-explaining, and built using well-commented, properly formatted HTML5 and CSS3 code. All styling has been moved to `style.css`, ensuring full separation between content and presentation.
